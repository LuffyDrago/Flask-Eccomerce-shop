# Flask Eccomerce shop 

## Welcome! üëã

## The challenge

The challenge is to build a Full-stack Eccomerce with Mpesa Integration.

## Motivation üöÄ

Learning Flask and Xamp database, and I thought this project design is the perfect way to apply what I've learned so far.

## User Stories

The users should be able to:

    * View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
    * See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with Jinja templates.

In the project directory, you can run: npm start to run the app in development mode.
Open http://vick.pythonanywhere.com/ view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Learning Outcomes‚ùó
- The overarching lesson for me in developing the site was project structure. 
- Connecting With the database and login in and sign up

- Creating the database and Hosting on pythonanywhere

## The Downside üò≠
Sadly I have to be refreshing my hosting platform (PythonAnywhere) Everyday because am Hosting the site on a free version platform
Bear with me if You Find an Error trying to reach the site.
